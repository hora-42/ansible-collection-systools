# Ansible Collection - hora.systools

Documentation for the collection "hora.systools".

The collection should give Ansible users access to serveral tools for administrative tasks on their systems. It starts, as consequence of my current needs, with a module to access the command "_authselect_" from Red Hat falvoured distributions.

## Modules

### _authselect_

As there is no module yet, there's no documentation either...
